This project was used to figure out and to demonstrate, how to develop a frontend UI with Facebook's *Relay* and *GraphQL* libraries.

For deep interns of the concepts, see the link:https://lowsky.github.io/deck-graphql-relay-talk[presentation at the EnterJS Conference] with its link:https://www.github.com/lowsky/deck-graphql-relay-talk[slide sources]

= Purpose of this dashboard

A web app showing the states of all (feature) branches and links to running docker containers for each feature.

An old presentation was giving some details about the background: link:https://github.com/lowsky/dockerMeetupSlides[slides]

= Getting started locally
Start a the backend-server locally, see https://github.com/lowsky/github-rest-graphql-proxy/ (in its own terminal),
then come back and do these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/lowsky/dashboard
cd dashboard
npm install # or better just run  yarn  (if you have installed it already)
npm start & # runs in background

node_modules/.bin/webpack -w
# and refresh the page in the browser
# (this needs update!)
